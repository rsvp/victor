#  _______________ VERIFICATION NOTES
#  
#  You can only verify an OriginStamp after the hash is submitted to the 
#  Bitcoin blockchain (once a day). The existence of the hash on
#  at OriginStamp.org alone isn't a proper proof yet.
#  
#  For the verification of already created timestamps OriginStamp.org is not
#  needed. All you need is:
#  
#       - The unhashed original file/text.
#       - The file with the aggregated hashes that was used to 
#         generate the Bitcoin address.
#       - A device with internet access to access the bitcoin blockchain to 
#         verify whether the bitcoin transaction actually took place.
#  
#  Take the seed, normally an aggregation of a bunch of hashes, to generate the
#  key-pair (private/public) and by this the recipient address. 
#  
#  Always keep your original sources and the whole seed, submitted to you by us.
#  With this combination (your original + seed) you can always recreate the hash
#  again and prove that your data was part of a certain Bitcoin transaction.
#  
#  Never alter your original! Any change, including changing a single space, or
#  editing the metadata will alter the hash that is unique to your original file.
