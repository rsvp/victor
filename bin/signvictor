# _______________|  signvictor : Sign commit timestamps of a repository.
#
#           Usage:  signvictor [repo_name=victor]
#
#        Examples:  $ ./signvictor
#                   #  Recommend execution relative to origin/master branch.
#
#    Dependencies:  gpg
#                   sha256sum
#
#    Git's SHA-1 commit identifiers should be cryptographically strengthened,
#    so we sign them as a group along with a timeline to document integrity, 
#    and also to compute the SHA-256 digest of that signed message.
#    By their joint public publication, we encourage open verification.
#
#  CHANGE LOG  LATEST version available:   https://git.io/victor

#      output per ISO and RFC standards." 
#      Esp. use ASCII encoding for glob and sorting characters. 
shopt -s   extglob
#     ^set extended glob for pattern matching.
shopt -s   failglob

set -o pipefail
#   ^exit status on fail within pipe, not (default) last command.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH for your contributions
to the distributed $prependf repository.
Each and every commit serves to strengthen
the repository's authenticity and integrity.

Selected commit timestamps have been embedded
into the Bitcoin blockchain. To obtain the transaction
date involving a particular HASH, please verify at
http://www.originstamp.org/s/HASH

The following are our commit timestamps on
$(date -R --utc) UTC
written as @UNIX_TIME seconds comma SHA-1 HASH digest
(note: such time is submitted by committer's machine,
and subject to further corroborating evidence):

git log --reverse --format="@%ct, %H" > $tmp2
#                   ^show commit Unix time and its full hash, CSV format.
#        ^commit order, not necessarily ordered by time, so...
sort $tmp2 >> $tmpf
echo       >> $tmpf


warn "Do NOT sign unless current git branch is at origin/master."
#  SIGN to prevent corruption:
gpg --clearsign $tmpf


#  Get hash of signed file, then rename signed file to mention that hash:
hash=$( sha256sum "${tmpf}.asc" | awk '{ print $1 }' )
signedf="/tmp/${prependf}_$(date -I --utc)_${hash}.txt"

mv "${tmpf}.asc" $signedf

echo " ::  Signed: $signedf "
